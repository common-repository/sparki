Use Sparki to manage your communication for open houses without answering your phone. This plugin helps you to connect to Sparki.

== Description ==

Sparki is a communication platform for real estate agents to reduce/remove the need to talk to prospects. Customers can directly schedule inbound appointments for house visits or intakes without involvement from you.

Itâ€™s a self-checkout for potential leads to schedule a house visit without talking to anyone. Visitors can visit your website, select the apartment they want to see and schedule an appointment.

You, the real estate agent, can set up the available schedule in the [Sparki dashboard](https://sparki.app/dashboard). Sparki makes sure all the timeslots will be filled automatically. Likewise, Sparki can automatically do all the scheduling and even possible rescheduling. We will keep both parties involved in touch via email.
